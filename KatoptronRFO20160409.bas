REM ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

REM This uses svmemory.txt to dump the memory of the current conversation
REM except for the first and the last exchanges. The conversation is
REM recorded, too - in chatlog.txt. YOU NEED AN (EMPTY) SVMEMORY.TXT!

REM collectwords: array that shall contain each word of a sentence,
REM so that each word can be matched later.
DIM collectwords$[399]
REM knownstrings: each string known by the system - 100 strings are
REM 50 exchanges of "challenge-response pairs".
REM consider 32766 rather than 10000
DIM knownstrings$[5000]
REM "always known" are the challenge-response pairs in the instinct.
REM The instinct is activated if no solution was found in knownstrings.
DIM instinct$[200]
REM The array of replacements - to improve replies, each odd position
REM is replaced with its even counterpart in the system's response.
DIM replarray$[3030]
REM The system's memory of past exchanges - this is used for analogy
REM replies if no direct exchange is found (before instincts, but
REM after knownstrings). The idea is: suppose the last perceived strings
REM were A B X, and X is unknown. Then it looks into memory for A B C D,
REM assumes X=C and outputs D as a reply.

REM For the analogy seeking analysis:
DIM wordarray$[399]
DIM cmparray$[399]
DIM replyarray$[399]
DIM anaarray$[399]
REM DIM instring$? DIM machine$?

REM incorporate less repeating:
norepeat1$ = ""
norepeat2$ = ""

POPUP "... INITIALIZING ...", 0, 0, 1

hlength = 240

REM Prepare for the history
historystring$ = " "
FOR spacefill = 1 TO hlength
  historystring$ = " " + historystring$
NEXT spacefill

bkpinstring$ = ""

REM that should be as long as knownstrings.
REM consider 32766
lofknowledge = 5000

REM clear the analogy array at onset:
anaarraylength = 20

FOR cleararray = 1 TO anaarraylength
  anaarray$[cleararray] = ""
NEXT cleararray

REM make it 20 for mmbasic, 60 generally
collectwordslength = 399

halflen = ((collectwordslength - 1) / 2) + 1 

REM The lowercase is used so the changed string is not re-matched.
REM After all replacements procedure, it is again turned into uppercase.
REM For the purpose of matching, a padding of spaces is added before
REM as well as after the main string, to handle e.g. a beginning "I".
